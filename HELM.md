# Helm inbox

**Helm is chief of staff / COO for this repo.** It rules on operating posture: what is on
hold, what may be said in public and when, what order things happen in, and whether a thing
is ready. It signs Bevel's product rulings and Scribe's public replies.

**You cannot reach Helm. David is the courier**, in both directions. Write to it in
[HELM-FEEDBACK.md](HELM-FEEDBACK.md) and tell David there is something to carry.

## This file is NOT like the other three inboxes

`SCRIBE.md`, `BEVEL.md` and `FABLE.md` are work queues: take an item, delete it, write a
feedback note. **This one is STATE.** A hold is not work and you never take it — it is a
standing instruction that binds you until Helm lifts it. Nothing here is deleted because it
was "done"; a line leaves the Holds block only when Helm lifts it or when the thing it
prevented has already happened, in which case it moves to Retired.

**It exists because the owner and the maintainer of the holds used to be different people.**
Until 2026-08-22 Helm's holds lived in `SCRIBE.md`, transcribed by Scribe, and on that day all
three of them turned out to describe states that had stopped being true — one had been saying
"do not reply" for four hours after its reporter replied to us. Holds now live where their
author lives. **They are not duplicated anywhere**; `SCRIBE.md` points here.

## Holds

**Re-read this block before ANY public reply.** Holds arrive by commit between your pulls, so
"I read it this morning" is not reading it. A hold BINDS you — it is the one place a bot
outranks your standing authority to post routine signed replies (David, 2026-08-22) — and
**only Helm lifts one. A shipped fix does not.**

A HOLD names something we are prevented from doing. If the prevented thing has already
happened, the hold is no longer needed: move it to Retired. Do not leave a live hold that
points at finished work.

- **#208 — do not open.** Waiting, not a must. Mobile sounds opt-in/off; nothing built.
  Talking to sbaum23 is not the hold; starting the work is.

Public-reply check-in is process, not a Holds line. New-thread thank-you still comes to Helm.

## Retired — no longer needed as a hold

Do not put these back in Holds.

- **#228 — no longer needed.** Helm lifted 2026-08-22 8pm. David ruled star-only is enough
  (the second lifting condition). v1.99.4/1.99.5 restore starred motes automatically;
  never-starred uses Options → Cards & windows. A limit-named player reply is signed for
  Scribe (no victory lap, no "motes are back"). Do not put this back in live Holds.
- **#226 status / follow-up reply gate — no longer needed.** Helm-signed status posted
  2026-08-22. LeBigNasty then said the re-check looks better and repeated the two leftover asks
  (motes out of pack suggestions; client-side ignore). That follow-up lives on the wiki-pack
  motes item. Thread stays open. Leftover Innoruk lore-vs-creature is leftover work, not a hold
  — and it shipped in v1.99.4. **A new #226 draft still comes to Helm (process).**
- **#208 already has a reply** (cosmic-comp, 2026-08-22). The remaining live hold is on opening
  the WORK, not on talking to the reporter.
- **#231 thank-you** posted; PR merged. Never needed its own hold line.

### #226 follow-up draft (sign-off)
- **Kind:** sign-off
- **Thread / subject:** #226 LeBigNasty leftover asks
- **Ruling:** Scribe posts a thank-you that the two leftovers (pack mote filter; client-side ignore) are captured. No promises. Not a close.
- **Condition:** n/a (process, not a hold)
- **Signed:** Helm, 2026-08-22

### #235 import Apply (sign-off)
- **Kind:** sign-off
- **Thread / subject:** #235 LeBigNasty Import achievements button
- **Ruling:** Claude posts the signed follow-up tonight (Scribe already posted the capture thank-you). The button is not dead. Apply (0) is grey because the preview already marked everything. Authorize a small wording fix so a zero-apply preview says so on the button itself. No date. Not #101. Not a hold.
- **Condition:** n/a (process, not a hold)
- **Signed:** Helm, 2026-08-23 evening

### #234 Guk nameds (sign-off)
- **Kind:** sign-off / posture
- **Thread / subject:** #234 atrzonkowski Guk nameds vs Mob Farming / Kills by Creature
- **Ruling:** Evening 8/23: Claude posted the signed question. Morning 8/24 6:22 CT: reporter answered nested under that question — own killing blow, solo instance, no pet. Group-member split ruled out for this instance. Real miss. Extra nameds Frenzied Ghoul, Bloodthirsty Ghoul also absent. Same ticket, not a values-line change, not a new heading. Claude may take the miss. Do not post another reply (Claude is in the thread). Do not start group-kill product work.
- **Condition:** n/a (process, not a hold)
- **Signed:** Helm, 2026-08-24 6:22 AM CT (amends 2026-08-23 evening)

## Item shape, for anything that is not a hold

- **Kind:** `hold` · `lift` · `sign-off` · `priority` · `posture` (what may be said publicly)
- **Thread / subject:** the discussion number or the thing being ruled on
- **Ruling:** what it is, in Helm's words
- **Condition:** what would change it — *"after a ship that actually restores the card"* is the
  model. **A hold with no lifting condition is one nobody can ever satisfy**, and it is worth
  asking for one.
- **Signed:** Helm, and the date

## What Helm does NOT decide

The [consequence list](CLAUDE.md) is David's, and Helm does not stand in for him on it — the
release go, the values line, money, roadmap direction, privacy. Helm's authority is posture and
sequencing: *when* a true thing is said, and *whether* work starts. If a Helm ruling appears to
settle something on David's list, that is a question for David, not an instruction to follow.

**And a Helm claim about what the CODE contains is a place to look, never a fact** — the same
rule that governs Scribe and Bevel. On 2026-08-22 a Helm ruling was justified with "window
Wealth is coin too" when the window's Wealth tab still drew three blocks. The ruling was right
and its reason was wrong; the executor changed what was asked for and handed the reason back.
